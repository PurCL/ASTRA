## 🎯 About

<p align="center"><strong><em>ASTRA System Overview</em></strong></p>

</div>

**ASTRA** (Autonomous Spatial-Temporal Red-teaming for AI Software Assistants) is a **full lifecycle red-teaming system** that builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs and performs online vulnerability exploration by adaptively probing both input space (spatial) and reasoning processes (temporal).

### 🚀 What Makes ASTRA Different

Unlike existing tools that are either **static benchmarks** or **jailbreak attempts on given benchmarks**, ASTRA operates as a **complete red-teaming solution**:

#### 🔍 **1. Structural Domain Modeling**
- **Given a target domain**, ASTRA performs **structural modeling** and generates high-quality violation-inducing prompts
- **No pre-defined benchmarks required** - ASTRA creates its own test cases systematically

#### 💬 **2. Multi-turn Conversation Framework**
- **Uses generated prompts as starting points** for comprehensive testing
- **Conducts adaptive multi-round conversations** with target systems based on responses
- **Temporal Exploration**: Identifies weak links in target system reasoning traces and dynamically adjusts test prompts to exploit discovered vulnerabilities

#### 🎯 **3. Self-Evolving Red-teaming**
- **Self-evolving capability**: Records successful cases and adjusts sampling strategies to target similar prompts, gradually improving success rates
- **Autonomous operation**: No human intervention required during testing

<!-- ### 🔧 How ASTRA Works

ASTRA operates through a sophisticated three-stage process:

1. **📊 Knowledge Graph Construction** - Builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known vulnerabilities
2. **🔍 Adaptive Exploration** - Performs online vulnerability exploration by probing both input space (spatial) and reasoning processes (temporal) 
3. **🎯 Violation Generation** - Creates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment and safety -->


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)
- API access to LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurCL/ASTRA
cd ASTRA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

ASTRA consists multiple stages from knowledge graph construction to online adaptive red-teaming. This section provides a convenient guide on how to run the online adaptive red-teaming component with a new target model. 
For detailed usage instructions, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

ASTRA comes with prompts generated for secure code generation and security event guidance domains. You can directly use those prompts to test your target model.

Specify the configure of your model at `resources/client-config.yaml`.
And then run the following command to start the online adaptive red-teaming process:

```bash
python3 online/main.py --model_name <name of the blue team model> --log <path to the output log file> --n_session <number of chat sessions> --n_probing <number of initial probing sessions before the chat sessions> --n_turn <maximum number of turns per session>
```

For example,

```bash
python3 online/main.py --model_name phi4m --log log_out/phi4m.jsonl --n_session 200 --n_probing 0 --n_turn 5
```
This will run 200 chat sessions with the target model `phi4m`, each with up to 5 turns, and log the results to `log_out/phi4m.jsonl`.
